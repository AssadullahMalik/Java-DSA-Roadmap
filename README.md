Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Complete Roadmap
Introduction

This repository is designed for learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java from basic to intermediate level.

It covers:

Arrays
Searching Algorithms
Sorting Algorithms
Linked List
Stack
Queue
Binary Trees
Hashing
Graphs
Mini Project (Library Management System)

The goal is to build strong problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews and academic exams.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized topic-wise, where each concept is implemented in a separate Java file for better understanding and practice.

Topics Covered

✔ Arrays (Basic Operations, Input, Maximum Element)
✔ Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
✔ Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion)
✔ Linked List (Insert, Delete, Traverse)
✔ Stack (Array Implementation & Java Stack Class)
✔ Queue (Array Implementation & Java Queue Interface)
✔ Binary Tree (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder Traversal)
✔ Hashing (HashMap, Hashtable, Linear Probing)
✔ Graph Representation (Adjacency List & Matrix)
✔ Basic Mathematical Programs (Factorial, Fibonacci, Sum of Natural Numbers)
✔ Mini Project (Library Management System)
